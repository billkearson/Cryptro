# Crypto

A simple example of using the crypto library.  
 
* Encrypt and decrypt a string using a secret key
* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
* Keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC)
* Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)

This is useful for keeping secrets safe and can be used to securely store confidential information. If you are using this for access credentials then realize that vaults or password managers are highly recommended to be used for credentials and keys. Keep it secret. Keep it safe.

## Getting Started

Download or pull the repository and open the solution in Visual Studio. The provided form will display the plaintext to be encrypted, the ciphertext that is encrypterd, and the secret. The user can click the buttons to encrypt or decrypt the text. 

## Built With

* [Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 
* [Microsoft .NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) 

## Conclusion

Finding flexible and secure ways to store information is critical. There are several options available and depending on your needs several might be needed. Here, we look at the symetric encryption cipher AES to encrypt/decrypt a string and hopefully learned something new.
